          <h2>CSGO Cheat</h2>
          <p>
            Counter strike global offensive is a popular multiplayer video game
            with over 1.4 Million active players. The cheat has multiple things
            inside including ESP(extra sensory input) which is boxes draw around
            players which render through walls, Aimbot which no matter where the
            user is looking will instantly lock onto the enemy, and a triggerbot
            which will auto-shoot if the users crosshair is over an enemy. This
            works by reading and writing to the games process memory in ram.
            popular video games, like counter-strike, have anti cheats which
            prevent random exe to attatch to the process and do exactly that.
            The way I got around Valve(the anticheat) was by coding a Kernel
            driver ,which operates with the highest permissions on a computer,
            and from that using a communicaiton method called IOCTL codes, which
            will send information i request from my user-mode exe, to the driver
            which will execute instructions. This is undetected by the
            anti-cheat. After getting a handle to the game, I then get the
            process ID and client base address. From there I can use memory
            offsets to find the player, entity list, and everything i need about
            the game. Once i get a valid enemy from the ent list, I can get the
            coordinates. But wait, not done yet. The coordinates are 3d which
            must be converted to 2d(on your screen) to be able to draw a box
            around them. For this I use a world-to-screen function, which is a
            formula that converts 3d coords to 2d. After that I use the popular
            rendering software ImGui to draw a box every frame around the
            player.

            <h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
            <p>
              This sudoku solver takes in a 9x9 sudoku board and using recursive
              backtracking, systematically solves the board. I was first making
              this in python, but realized i could do it in c++, making it solve
              instantly. First, we have to define what the rules for sudoku are.
              1. Each row and column must contain a number from 1-9, without
              repetitions. 2. the digits can only occur once per block(nonet).
              3. The sum of every single row, column, and nonet must equal 45.
              Now to the code. First it has to find an empty cell. For that
              empty cell, it has to try each number from 1-9. Then validate the
              placement to see if the number in the cell satisfies all rules. If
              it is valid, call the solver function to solve the remaining grid.
              If no number can be placed that satisfies all constraints,
              backtrack by undoing the current placement and then it tries the
              next number.
