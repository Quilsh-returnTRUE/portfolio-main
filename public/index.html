              <p id="projects">
                I've been programming for around 3 years, starting off in a
                HighSchool python and JavaScript class. These classes didn't
                teach me much about coding but definetly sparked my interest. I
                would do extra projects at home, outside of the assigned ones.
                In March of 2024, I left behind higher level languages and
                started learning lower-level, like c++ and c#. I came to fall in
                love with c++ and still do code in it every day. I also started
                working on web applications, like this one, about June of 2024.
              </p>

              <p>
                In my freetime I enjoy hunting, shooting guns, hanging out with
                friends, and swimming. I am also a Muay Thai fighter and with my
                8 year wrestling background, fell in love with BJJ and
                competing.

                  <h2>CSGO Cheat</h2>
                  <p>
                    Counter strike global offensive is a popular multiplayer
                    video game with over 1.4 Million active players. The cheat
                    has multiple things inside including ESP(extra sensory
                    input) which is boxes draw around players which render
                    through walls, Aimbot which no matter where the user is
                    looking will instantly lock onto the enemy, and a triggerbot
                    which will auto-shoot if the users crosshair is over an
                    enemy. This works by reading and writing to the games
                    process memory in ram. popular video games, like
                    counter-strike, have anti cheats which prevent random exe to
                    attatch to the process and do exactly that. The way I got
                    around Valve(the anticheat) was by coding a Kernel driver
                    ,which operates with the highest permissions on a computer,
                    and from that using a communicaiton method called IOCTL
                    codes, which will send information i request from my
                    user-mode exe, to the driver which will execute
                    instructions. This is undetected by the anti-cheat. After
                    getting a handle to the game, I then get the process ID and
                    client base address. From there I can use memory offsets to
                    find the player, entity list, and everything i need about
                    the game. Once i get a valid enemy from the ent list, I can
                    get the coordinates. But wait, not done yet. The coordinates
                    are 3d which must be converted to 2d(on your screen) to be
                    able to draw a box around them. For this I use a
                    world-to-screen function, which is a formula that converts
                    3d coords to 2d. After that I use the popular rendering
                    software ImGui to draw a box every frame around the player.

                    <h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
                    <p>
                      This sudoku solver takes in a 9x9 sudoku board and using
                      recursive backtracking, systematically solves the board. I
                      was first making this in python, but realized i could do
                      it in c++, making it solve instantly. First, we have to
                      define what the rules for sudoku are. 1. Each row and
                      column must contain a number from 1-9, without
                      repetitions. 2. the digits can only occur once per
                      block(nonet). 3. The sum of every single row, column, and
                      nonet must equal 45. Now to the code. First it has to find
                      an empty cell. For that empty cell, it has to try each
                      number from 1-9. Then validate the placement to see if the
                      number in the cell satisfies all rules. If it is valid,
                      call the solver function to solve the remaining grid. If
                      no number can be placed that satisfies all constraints,
                      backtrack by undoing the current placement and then it
                      tries the next number.

                    <h2>Asteroid clone</h2>
                    <p>
                      This is an asteroid game clone which i never got the time
                      to finish but all that is left is adding custom sprites
                      like spaceship and asteroid. There is bullets, the
                      spaceship, large asteroids, and smaller asteroids. The
                      movement is only to swivel left & right and to "thurst" to
                      move foward. The rendering is done with the SFML c++
                      library. The physics for drifting when is implemented on
                      the player so the only way to stop is to turn and thrust
                      the other direction in which you are moving. Also the
                      large asteroids once hit split into 2 smaller asteroids.
                      Once those small asteroids break, you get points and they
                      disapear. You also have 3 lives which can be taken by
                      flying into the asteroids with my collision detection.
